# HeyApp
Android Project
 This project is compiled using visual studio 17 and xamarin.

About
  This app takes the caller number and call status (whether it is incoming ,outgoing,answering or Idle) and updates it to my server and
  from there my python program takes over the data and ring the bell accordingly.
  It also has a Feedback activity that just allows to send mail to the developer with any feed back.
Extra
  The python desktop client and Php code are also shared here.
